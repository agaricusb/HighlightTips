A simple client mod for Minecraft to show information about the the block highlighted at your cursor tip.

showing you the name of the liquid within and capacity of the tank you're looking at:

The block ID and metadata is shown, followed by the block name, the item name dropped, and finally the item damage value.

It also has support for multiple inventories:
